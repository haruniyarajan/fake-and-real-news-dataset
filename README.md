# fake-and-real-news-dataset

Task 
Step 1 - Baseline 
Develop a binary classification model to distinguish between fake and authentic news articles using the Fake-And-Real News Kaggle dataset.  
 
The dataset contains articles from 3 domains: News, Politics, and Other.  
 
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1):  
Overall performance across all domains  
Performance stratified by domain  
 
Conduct feature importance analysis to identify key predictors that differentiate authentic from fake news across the three domains.  
 
You may use any modeling approach - pre-trained models, custom architectures, or ensemble methods.  

Step 2 - Improvement 
After establishing your baseline model and completing initial analysis, implement techniques to improve model performance.  
 
Potential improvement directions: 
auxiliary datasets to augment the provided data - we value your expertise in identifying relevant supplementary sources.  
advanced feature engineering 
different model architectures 
ensemble methods 
 
Document your methodological decisions and quantify performance improvements with appropriate metrics.
